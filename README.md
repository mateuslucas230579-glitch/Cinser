A sovereign computing environment developed by **Tervia Corporation**. **Tervia Cinser** is not just a system; it is a statement on how modern software should respect the user.

## 📖 Philosophy & Vision

Tervia Cinser is built on three fundamental pillars:

1. **Privacy by Design:** In an era of constant surveillance, Tervia Cinser is engineered to be a fortress. We do not implement telemetry, tracking, or "phone home" features. Your data stays where it belongs: with you.
2. **Freedom:** Licensed under **GPLv3**, we ensure that the system remains open for study, modification, and redistribution. We believe in the democratization of technology.
3. **Simplicity & Performance:** Written in C and Assembly, the system follows a minimalist approach, avoiding the "bloatware" of modern environments to provide raw performance and security.
